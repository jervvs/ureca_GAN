# ureca_GAN

As part of my school's Undergraduate Research Programme (URECA) at the Dauwels Lab, I studied generative adversarial networks and variational auto-encoders and their applications on disentangled representation and explainable artificial intelligence. This repository contains my implementation of GANs in PyTorch as well as a short paper on disentangled representation.
