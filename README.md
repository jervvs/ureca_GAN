# ureca_GAN

As part of my school's Undergraduate Research Programme (URECA) at the Dauwels Lab, I studied generative adversarial networks and variational auto-encoders and their applications on disentangled representation and explainable artificial intelligence. This repository contains my implementation of GANs in PyTorch as well as a short paper on disentangled representation.

**What are GANs?**

Insert: Brief Intro about GANs

Insert: Short intro on Explainable AI and how generative models & GANs help.

Beyond their applications on disentangled representation, GANs and their applications are super interesting. Below are the GANs that I have implemented.

**GANs Implemented**

1) Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)
2) InfoGAN
3) StarGAN
4) StackGAN
